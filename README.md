I started programming with Javascript, at the time I've always wanted to program but never knew how to start.
I talked to people on Discord and discovered you can make Discord bots with Javascript.
Discord bots were a good excuse to me to learn programming fundementals and concepts. 
I volunteered to work on a project with other programmers, this lead me to learn alot; even moving onto Typescript. 

Though, now I am the only active programmer on the [Mr Poll](https://mrpoll.xyz) project: 
pushing it forward with a rewrite in Go and also making it [open source](https://github.com/via-development/mr-poll).

### What I'm working on

- The [Mr Poll](https://mrpoll.xyz) Discord bot
- I am reading [Writing an Intrepeter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com) by Thorsten Ball

### What I want to do

- Get better at building websites
- Build a desktop application
- Use Docker efficiently
- Learn the c++ & Zig programming language
